        <h2><em>Currently in Progress!</em></h2>

        <p>Repo <a href="https://github.com/lucieneckert/RandomMysteryDungeonGen">here</a>.</p>

        <p>The goal of this project is to create a system that can produce randomly
            generated images that feel reminiscent of the environments found in the DS
            entries of the <em>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon</em> series, almost like screenshots that never existed. This is an artistic
            project, so the goal is to make something visually (and nostalgically)
            pleasing -- and, if all goes well, hook it up to a Twitter bot that can
            tweet one a few times a day.</p>


        <h2>Step 1: Dungeon Snapshot Generation</h2>

        <p>The first step of the project was to find a way to produce randomly-generated
            representations of dungeon "snapshots" (basically enough to take up the
            width of a DS screen) that could then be graphically dressed-up to produce
            our final output. The first approach I took was to encode a dungeon in a 2D numpy array, with the following basic scheme:</p>
        
        <pre><code>
            0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
            1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 
            0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 
            0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
            0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 

            0 = wall tile
            1 = floor tile
        </code></pre>

        <p>This let me create snapshot representations by initializing a dungeon as an
            all-zero (all walls) array of a given shape, then place rooms (regions that
            aren't all wall) on top of it by adding arrays with some non-zero regions.
            The initial algorithm I used was roughly as follows:
            <ol>
                <li>Create a dungeon array of shape (x, y) where all elements are 0</li>
                <li>Choose a random "main room" to generate (based on max size x, y)) and place it on the dungeon at a random but legal location.</li>
                <li>Create hallways to the border of the snapshot 1-3 times by choosing a random spot that isn't a wall and replacing all walls from there until an edge with floor.</li>
                <li>Return the array representation of the dungeon.</li>
            </ol>

            The system could then produce outputs such as these:
        </p>

        <div class='project-info-gallery'>
            <pre><code>
[[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]     
[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]
                </code></pre>
            <pre><code>
[[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
[0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.]
[1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.]
[0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 0.]
[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]]
                </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>As an initial approach, these are servicable and reminiscent enough of the dungeon layout generation within the <em>Mystery Dungeon</em> series.</p>

        <p><em>Next Steps:</em> Differntiate between inner wall, floor-adjacent, corner, etc. tiles in this representation. Also, consider generating pools of water.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Mapping Tilesets onto Snapshot Representations</h2>

        <p>Creating some initial images to better visualize these representations is easy enough. We want every tile to be 32x32, so using PIL to generate images of the proper size from a given array's shape and "pasting" tiles at certain positions, we can already make some images with placeholder graphics:</p>

        <div class='project-info-gallery'>
            <figure><img src="../res/project-info-res/rmd/initial-0.png" alt=""></figure> 
            <figure><img src="../res/project-info-res/rmd/initial-1.png" alt=""></figure> 
        </div>

        <p><em>Next Steps:</em> Generate and use more appropriate tilesets, etc.</p>

        <h2>Steps 3-n: TBD</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Create character sprites to populate the dungeons
            </li>
            <li>
                Create Twitter bot to post output of the system
            </li>
        </ol>
