        <h2>Enjoyable Block Game</h2>
<p>
    A game made as a final project for <a
                href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP21/class/MUSIC/2701">
                MUSIC 2701: Music and Digital Gameplay</a>. The main focus of
            the
            project was to study ways to represent the push and pull of action
            and
            puzzle gameplay elements through sound design.
        </p>
<p>
    Four players would compete in two teams -- one teammate each
            controlling
            either an action-platforming climber or a Tetris-esque
            block-dropping UFO,
            working together to have the climber reach the trophy at the top of
            the
            screen.

                        Screenshot of the game's action phase. The two teams (blue and red) are competing to
                        have their climber reach the trophy. Blue's UFO has placed a few blocks to build a way up,
                        and the climber has traversed them somewhat. The powerups each climber has is also on
                        display -- blue's climber must have taken a jump potion to make it up there (the initial
                        jump height of each player is one block) and the red climber has double-jump-enabling wings.

                        Screenshot of the game's puzzle phase. The climber and UFO on each team have the chance
                        to select one of three power-ups to enhance their abilities. For the UFO, these powerups
                        can change the block distribution, movement speed, and cooldown time, etc. For the climber,
                        powerups may increase speed, jump height, block-breaking ability, knockback when attacking
                        the other climber, etc.

            <p>
                Between rounds (after one team gets the trophy) all players would
            have the chance to select one power-up to change their abilities in
            some way. These powerups would stack between rounds, meaning careful
            players could find ways to create powerful synergies.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Since this was produced for a class studying the intersection of
                music and gameplay, the main challenge of this project was designing a
                sound system that reflected the gameplay in novel ways, and
                building up the code that could create those designed effects. Cutting a
                long story short, this ended up revolving around encoding the state of the
                gameplay in a "sound vector" with three components of values ranging
                from 0 to 1 -- one describing the relative activity level of the puzzle
                players of each team versus the action players of each, one describing
                the "phase" of the game (the phases described by the screenshots above),
                and one encoding the intensity of the current round (measured by how close
                each player is to the trophy). Using this information, the game attempts to string
                together chords / melody fragments and layering tracks to create a
                soundtrack reflective of the state of the gameplay.
