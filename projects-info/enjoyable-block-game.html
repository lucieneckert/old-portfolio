        <h2>Enjoyable Block Game</h2>
        <p>A game made as a final project for <a
                href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP21/class/MUSIC/2701">
                MUSIC 2701: Music and Digital Gameplay</a>. The main focus of
            the
            project was to study ways to represent the push and pull of action
            and
            puzzle gameplay elements through sound design.
        </p>
        <p>Four players would compete in two teams -- one teammate each
            controlling
            either an action-platforming climber or a Tetris-esque
            block-dropping UFO,
            working together to have the climber reach the trophy at the top of
            the
            screen.</p>
        <p>Between rounds (after one team gets the trophy) all players would
            have the chance to select one power-up to change their abilities in
            some way. These powerups would stack between rounds, meaning careful
            players could find ways to create powerful synergies.</p>
        <p>More detailed information on this project and the design/development process
            can be found in <a href="../res/ebg-rationale.pdf">this
                rationale</a>.</p>
