        <h2>A Small Game About Juiceboxes</h2>
        <p>My first solo game project made using Godot Engine. Developed over three months in quarantine,
            the
            focus of this project was to experiment with game "juice" (hence the name) and familiarize
            myself
            with the process of developing a game from start to finish.
        </p>

        <p>
            A sidescrolling "bullet-heck", the game involves maneuvering a juicebox around the stage while dodging
            pink obstacles. To discourage camping in a corner, each juicebox can activate an ability to either
            dodge, shield, or move around the stage at the cost of a juice resource, which can be refilled by
            picking up powerups that spawn near the sides of the stage. As the game progresses, the obstacles
            increase in frequency, intensity, and speed -- and new, tougher patterns are added to the mix.
        </p>

        <p>From the start, I focused a lot on having the character movement feel good. Using a juicebox as a player object
            meant not having a lot of ways to convey movement through gestures, so I relied a lot on particle
            effects, both real and "fake" (using animated sprites instead of the engine's particle features).
            Making sure the jump arc felt good (and had a controllable height) was also important, since the
            game required very precise movement at times. Other small touches, like having the pointer react
            to clicks in a clear way, menu items jostle when selected, and generous use of screen shake
            were implemented to ensure the game felt as responsive to the player's actions as possible.
        </p>

        <p>The game also featured a multiplayer mode. Last the longest to gain a point, whereupon the stage
            shuffles and the difficulty increases until one player hits 10. It supports up to four players, 
            using either keyboard & mouse or gamepad. It was difficult to manage the inputs (and especially
            difficult to test), but I'm proud of how it came out -- learning more about how to make good party
            games is a particular goal of mine, so I learned a lot from developing this feature of the game especially!
        </p>
        
        <p>Compared to other projects where the sound design had to more strictly adhere
            to a theme, the more abstract "setting" of this game let me experiement more with
            making sounds that had the primary focus of just sounding good. I still have a long
            way to go as a composer, but I enjoyed having that freedom when making the background
            tracks and really tried to make them varied enough such that they don't get old --
            especially since the game isn't easy. For the sound effects, I tried to make them sound
            "juicy" and used the same synthesizer instruments to create them so they meshed together.
            I think they added a lot to the game feel, especially since a bunch of them play at once.
            One small detail is that the sounds that play when the most common obstacles spawn vary around a
            C minor chord, the same chord the background tracks center around, adding sort of a non-obtrusive randomized miny
            melody to
            reflect the random distribution
            of obstacles during gameplay.
        </p>

        <p>Finally, I implemented an achievement system within the game, letting players unlock skins and stages
            as they play. Since ability types are tied to juicebox skin, I made sure the player stars with one of
            each unlocked -- and, stage unlocks are locked behind the more straightforward achievements, I tried
            to make the content as accessible as possible. Figuring out ways to let the game track unlock
            conditions (and especially letting the player know in real-time when they get one) efficiently was a 
            cool challenge to tackle. 
        </p>

        <p>Overall, I'm really happy with how this game came out. It was tough molding it into a finished product
            without a clear goal at the outset, but the game feel touches and content scope made it end up feeling much
            juicier than I could've ever hoped.
