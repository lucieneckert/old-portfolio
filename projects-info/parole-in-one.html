        <p>Produced as a semester-long project for <a
                href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3152/2020sp/">INFO 3152:
                Introduction
                to Game Development</a>. I worked as a designer on a team
            of 8 people, primarily focusing on sound design and level design, as well as
            creating
            a few animations and
            facilitating playtesting sessions.</p>

        <p>Our project's high-concept statement was as follows:</p>

        <blockquote>In a world where golfing is illegal, one minigolf star must live out
            their dream behind bars. Outwit guards, sink contraband golf balls, and
            cause the greatest prison break of the century!
            In this game where stealth meets golf, solve puzzles and avoid guards only
            using
            your trusty golf ball. Activate alarms and buttons while skillfully
            navigating
            through a prison golf course, but when you get spotted by a guard, be
            prepared
            to putt for your life. With enough skill, you can even beat the par and
            unlock
            new ball costumes to play with. Combining lighthearted fun with stressful
            escapes, our game promises to provide all our players with a whimsical fun
            time!
        </blockquote>

        <p>The game is an entry into the underutilized stealth-golf genre. Players
            attempt to avoid guards with careful strokes and reach the goal under par.
            If they're spotted, it isn't a game over yet -- quick-witted players can attempt
            to evade guard hitboxes and escape sight for long enough to reset guard patrols or reach the level's
            end.</p>

        <p>About halfway through the semester, Cornell switched to fully remote classes.
            It was still the extremely early stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic, so our
            team was unfamiliar with remote work. We managed to keep our momentum going,
            and although the scope of our project had to be reduced, I'm proud of what
            we were all able to accomplish in such a short time under those conditions!
        </p>

            During this project, those on the design subteam had to work a lot on generating design docs and 
            assets for the course's labs. I worked briefly on some concept art:

            A large portion of the work I did revolved around level design. I focused a lot on remixing 
            simple blocks of our game's main mechanics in order to use our game objects
            in interesting ways. For example, our alarm trigger was introduced as a tool
            to lure guards to certain locations. In some levels, though, forced interaction
            with it turns an otherwise slow-paced stealth game into an escape sequence where
            the player's focus has to be juggled between making quick decisions and lining
            up the perfect shot:
        </p>

        <section class='project-info-gallery'>
            <figure><img src="../res/project-info-res/pio/alarm-intro.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Here, the player is is taught to use the alarm tile to lure
                    a guard away from the goal. This notion of the alarm as a tool is
                    useful to carry over to other levels.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure><img src="../res/project-info-res/pio/scramble-level.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>Here, the alarm becomes a forced detriment to the player's
                    navigation by sending both guards towards a bottleneck in the level, leaving the
                    player to hit all the buttons while evading them.
                </figcaption>

        <p>Many levels also create different conditions of constraints and freedom.
            Some levels present the player with small, novel situations and 
            encourage them to find the most satisfying solution, while others provide a larger
            sequence of varied challenges and give the player more freedom to choose what
            playstyle they want to use.

            <figure><img src="../res/project-info-res/pio/guard-buttons.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>The challenge in this level revolves around the player lining up 
                    the perfect shot, without much time pressure. It also uses the guard robots
                    in a helpful way -- instead of being an obstacle, it inadvertently hits buttons
                    on its patrol route that enable and disable doors for the player.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure><img src="../res/project-info-res/pio/big-level.png" alt="">
                <figcaption>This level is a gauntlet of skirmishes with odd geometry and guard
                    patrols. The player has the option to slip through slowly and stealthily, swerve through
                    the level as fast as possible, or line up careful shots that traverse vast chunks
                    of it as efficiently as they can.

        <p>Around the final week of the project, I got the chance to add some
            world-building touches (and subtle tutorials) to the environment with some decorative assets
            (mainly, in-world posters):

            The animation work I did for this project was primarily for the ball and goal
            objects. We went through a few iterations of goal designs, ranging from adhering to a
            jagged, makeshift prison aesthetic to a more usable and constrasting design:

            <img class='small' src="../res/project-info-res/pio/usable-goal.gif" alt="ball slipping into highlighted hole">
        </section>

        <p>I also enjoyed making unlockable costumes for the player's ball, along with custom animations for reaching the end of a level:</p>

            <img class='small' src="../res/project-info-res/pio/donut.gif" alt="donut ball entering hole">

        </section>

        <p>Finally, I spent a lot of time on the game's sound design. We found it tough to balance the 
            harsh, prison vibe with the whimsical feeling we wanted our game to explore visually, and 
            I also had trouble coping with it auditorally. Tweaking the alarms and robot noises to be
            just cartoon-y enough was an interesting task to conceptualize and work on -- one scrapped
            idea was to have a speech synthesizer sarcastically compliment the player whenever they were
            caught. In producing the music, I ended up creating almost 10 total half-finished tracks for the level music
            before narrowing it down to just one that struck the vibe our group wanted particularly well.
            More information about the soundtrack to be added soon.
