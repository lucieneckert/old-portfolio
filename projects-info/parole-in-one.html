        <h2>Parole in One</h2>
        <p>Produced as a semester-long project for <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3152/2020sp/">INFO 3152:
            Introduction
            to Game Development</a>. I worked as a designer on a team
        of 8 people, primarily focusing on sound design and level design, as well as creating
        a few animations and
        facilitating playtesting sessions.</p>

        <p>About halfway through the semester, Cornell switched to fully remote classes.
            It was still the extremely early stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic, so our
            team was unfamiliar with remote work. We managed to keep our momentum going,
            and although the scope of our project had to be reduced, I'm proud of what
            we were all able to accomplish in such a short time under those conditions.
