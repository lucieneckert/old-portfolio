        <p>A Tetris-esque game developed as a final project for CS 3110: Data Structures and Functional Programming.
            I worked on a team of four to develop a robust piece of software using the language OCaml, and we decided to
            emulate the Field Climber mode of Tetris Party for the Wii, with some added features.</p>

        <p>Using functional programming to build a game was a new experience to me, and figuring out the flow of the
            game
            without relying on a mutable state was a challenge that put me way out of my comfort zone. I specialized in
            building out
            our board interface and implementation, handling the manipulation of pieces as they fall, updating the cells
            dropped on the board,
            and the hold and next pieces queues -- basically, all the functionality that takes in a board and spits out
            another board as the game runs.
        </p>

        <p>We ended up finishing our main functionality ahead of schedule, giving us the chance to build out some
            extra features. I was responsible for adding different themes to the game, automatically loading JSON files
            from a directory, each with a clear structure that allows the user to add their own if decided.

        <p>We also allowed the user to choose various game speeds and keep track of their scores. Things could get
            pretty hectic on the highest difficulty:

        <p>The visuals are a little rough around the edges, but considering we made the choice to draw everything
            on-screen with primitive shapes to reduce the number of packages we were dependent on, I'm happy
            with how the game turned out!
