        <h2>Springs With Guns (Working Title)</h2>
        <p>
            Currently in the prototyping/early-development phase. An attempt to
            produce a casual platform fighting game with an emphasis on simple controls and a
            reliance on the interaction
            between spring
            physics and gun recoil for movement.

        <p>
            It's taking a while to refine the movement system. Making things "springy" with Godot Engine's
            built-in physics engine wasn't immediately obvious -- especially when it was important for
            the player to be able to manually compress it and use the release as the primary force of
            movement. Here are some iterations the player character's physics went through:

                <figcaption>Initial model of the springy player. Uses a box with spring joints that resists the inwards
                    forces of the top and bottom "planes." Fakes the release force by bumping the player upwards.

            <figure class='large'><video controls src="../res/project-info-res/swg/initial_1.mp4"></video>
                <figcaption>The next iteration of the springy player. More "realistic" spring-like construction, with more
                    accurate compression and less-obvious extra force added to improve the feel of the release. However,
                    it's prone to getting tangled up in itself and flying away...

            <figure class='large'><video controls src="../res/project-info-res/swg/initial_2.mp4"></video>
                <figcaption>The near-current iteration of the springy player. Higher-resistence overall
                    works to combat tangling, while still visually reflecting a "springy" feel. The arrows
                    are a debug feature showing where the game expects to add a bit of force to help the
                    player move when the spring contraction is released. Still somewhat buggy at that point.

        <p>Even after refining the springy composition of the player, the "tangling-up" problem was still
            present after getting hit by another player's bullet:
